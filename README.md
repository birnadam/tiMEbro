## Reasoning/Motivation

Productivity app to keep our todos in order, check the weather, and utilize the pomodoro technique for increasing productivity! 

## Technologies Used
* jQuery & Vanilla JS (DOM manipulation, event listeners, time manipulation)
* Local Storage (Keep track of todos, weather of specific city)
* AccuWeather API
* FontAwesome & Google Fonts
* Bootstrap 

## Challenges

* Piecing together a bunch of different components into one, organization within code instead of components like in React which we were used to
* Refresher on jQuery, DOM manipulation and vanilla JS as we have been using ES6+ with React and MERN

## Contributors
* Birna Dam
* Garrett Young

## Next Steps

* Making this in react perhaps pairing it with a database for users to use
